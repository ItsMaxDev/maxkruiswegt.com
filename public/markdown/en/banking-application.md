### 🏦 Banking Application
This web app was my big project for my second year Java and Web Development courses at Inholland Haarlem. It's a pretend bank system, made to help learn about building secure websites that handle money, like making payments, keeping track of users, and keeping everything safe. It uses Java Spring Boot for the server side and Vue.js for the user interface.

#### Technologies 💻
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Maven, JWT Security
- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Pinia, Vite, JavaScript, HTML, Tailwind CSS

&nbsp;

#### Features ✨
The app lets users do a lot of the things you can do with a real bank, like:

- 🔓 **Account Management**: You can open, use, and close different kinds of bank accounts, like checking and savings, each with its own rules.

- 🛡️ **Security**: Keeping users safe is very important. You can sign up, log in, and do your banking securely. We use JWT to make sure your data stays safe.

- 💵 **Transactions**: You can deposit, withdraw, and transfer money. The app makes sure all these actions follow the rules, just like a real bank.

- 👥 **Roles**: There are two types of users: customers and employees. Customers manage their money, and employees can see all accounts, approve new ones, and set limits.

- 🏦 **Real Banking Feel**: From signing up to checking your transactions, it feels like using a real bank. You get a full view of your financial activities.

- 🎓 **Learning Tool**: This app is also a way to learn about web development. It shows how to build secure connections, manage a database, and more.

This app is a great example of how to use web development skills to make something practical, educational, and functional. It shows off how to use Java Spring Boot and Vue.js to create a secure, useful, and user-friendly web app.
