#### 📜 Project Overview

Welcome to Project Planner, a dynamic project management web application! It's built using Vue 3 for the frontend and PHP for the backend, creating a seamless single-page application experience. The frontend communicates with the backend via API calls, which are processed and interacted with the database by the backend. Interested in the code?
